# Password generator
I made Password Generator using Python

## Steps of Installation
### 1. Download the code

### 2. Open the code with an IDE
Open the folder `passwordgen` on [Pycharm](https://jetbrains.com/pycharm), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudiocode.com/) or other code editors

### 3. Install the packages
On your terminal and type ```pip install requirements.txt``` to install all the required packages

### 4. Run the Code
Run `ui.py` on your IDE or terminal

## How does the program work
Using the package `random`, we get a random item from a list.
And using the package `string`, we get all the string, integers, symbols.
According user's want, we modify the the list to have a string, an integer or a symbol.
I used the package `ttkbootstrap`, a modernised `tkinter` package to make all the front end UIs.
